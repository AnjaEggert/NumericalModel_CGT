! properties of processes:
! name=           fortran variable name for the rate
! description=    e.g. "grazing of zooplankton"
! turnover=       fortran formula for calculating the process turnover [mol/kg or mol/m2]
! equation=       equation which, like a chemical equation, lists reaction agents and products of this process.
!                   example: t_no3 + 1/16*t_po4 -> t_lpp
!                   tracers to the left of the "->" are consumed, tracers to the right of the "->" are produced by this process.
! feedingEfficiency= name of an auxiliary variable (values 0..1) which tells how much of the food in a certain depth is accessible for the predator with vertLoc=FIS. Relevant for vertLoc=FIS only. Default="1.0"
! isActive=       1=active (default); 0=process is switched off
! isOutput=       1=occurs as output in model results; 0=internal use only (default)
! limitation=     TYPE tracer > value else otherProcess
! limitation=     TYPE tracer < value else otherProcess
!                   TYPE = HARD (theta function), MM (Michaelis-Menten), MMQ (quadratic Michaelis-Menten), IV (Ivlev), IVQ (quadratic Ivlev), LIN (linear), TANH (tangens hyperbolicus)
!                   tracer = name of tracer that needs to be present
!                   value = value that needs to be exceeded, may also be a constant or auxiliary
!                   otherProcess = process that takes place instead if this process gets hampered by the availability of "tracer"
!                 several of these lines may exist, the order of them may be relevant for the rate of "otherProcess".
! processType=    type of process, e.g. "propagation", default="standard"
! repaint=        number n of repainting actions to be done by the process, default=0
!                 This line is followed by n lines of this kind:
!   <oldColor> <element> = <newColor>    e.g.: "all  N   = blue "
!                                              "blue P   = none "
!                                              "red  all = green"
! vertLoc=        WAT=z-dependent (default), SED=in the sediment only, SUR=in the surface only, FIS=fish-type behaviour
! comment=        comment, default=""
!
! Process rates are calculated in the given order.
